CTF Challenge Write-up: Packets Primer
1. Challenge Information
CTF Name: picoCTF
Challenge Name: Packets Primer
Category: Forensics
Difficulty: Easy
Challenge Description: Analyze the given network capture file (network-damp.flag.pcap) to find the hidden flag.
2. Initial Analysis
Provided File: network-damp.flag.pcap
Tool Used: Wireshark
First Thoughts: Since the challenge name suggests a basic introduction to network packets, the flag might be easily found by skimming through the captured packets.
3. Exploitation Approach
Step 1: Opening the PCAP File in Wireshark
Loaded network-damp.flag.pcap in Wireshark.
Observed that the capture contained only 9 data packets.
Step 2: Skimming Through the Packets
Since there were very few packets, manually inspected each one.
Found the flag in the 4th packet, which was a PSH ACK packet.
(Not sure if the PSH ACK flag was relevant, but this packet contained the flag in its payload.)
4. Getting the Flag

Extracted Flag: picoCTF{p4ck37_5h4rk_01b0a06}

5. Lessons Learned & Takeaways
Key Takeaways:
In small PCAP files, manually inspecting packets can be an effective strategy.
The PSH ACK packet might indicate data transmission, but in this case, it was just where the flag was located.
