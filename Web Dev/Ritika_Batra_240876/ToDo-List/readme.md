I have created a Todo list in react . With each task input field, I have created  add and Remove task buttons.
Using the UseState hook , I have created a state named taskList which is an array . Dynamically elements are added to the array when "Add a task" is pressed.
Similarly elements are removed too using splice method when "Remove task is pressed."
Everytime a new task is added,I create a new array named List which concatinates the original array with the new element(task)  and replace the original array with the new one.
